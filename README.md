# elm-snake
Classic snake game created with elm-ui. In this version the food is replenished
in batches, not one by one.

- The game is over if the snake bites itself or it hits
the wall.
- Snake grows with each chomp.
- The longer the snake, the faster it moves.
- The game is controlled only from keyboard, so please make sure you have focus
on the game page. Or just focus on it by clicking the start screen.
